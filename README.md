Description of completed features.
We do almost complete the Library function which show case the festivals that can be celebrate within the region of batangas, in addition we create the shop but we are still making some major changes because we are task to create first a POS & Inventory Management system in which we do almost complete. just access the video on the gdrive link so you can see.

Challenges faced and solutions applied.
For the challenges that we faced on creating this project , at first we do plan to add the bidding system on the art work for the local artisan within batangas but we find it hard because of the time alotted, we cannot find artist that is willing to give there art pieces and so we do plan to drop the Idea of bidding system and drop the category of arts within the library and we focus on the festivals only because it might be the cause of the delay of submission of our output, next is the shop at first we do plan to get an payment api's but almost all of the api's avalable online has a huge amount of cost in which we resorted on just creating it as a qrcode and just add an integration which is the POS & Inventory Management System.
 
Next steps planned for final completion.
We do plan to consult to our instructor about the front end design because us the developer of this project is not confident within our skills in UI?UX design, We do plan too to seek help or consult to our Instructors in database for the Inventory system because we still have some problems in storing products within the tables like the products which are returned, damage , etc....
in summary , for our next plan for the final completion is to seek help and guidance to someone which is capable and confident in doing in this things specially in ecommerece field

List of any research sources referenced so far.
So far we do utilize the use of Youtube and AI's for us to create this project, we create this project from scratch so I'm sure that it has alot of bugs and field errors.

TY and God Bless ^_^ !!!!
